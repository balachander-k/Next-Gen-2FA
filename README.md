# Web3OTP 

Web3OTP is a wallet-based authentication system that stores 2FA secrets with public-key encryption in a decentralized storage system based on the Zk rollup protocol. Only the user can decrypt or view these secrets, and they can generate dynamic OTP tokens for web2 and web3-based applications, based on Internet Engineering Task Force standard RFC 6238. Access is possible on any device by connecting an EVM-based wallet.


## Web3OTP mitigates all the issues in the current 2FA, such as:

### Storage and Data Availability Issues
Traditional 2FA relies on a single central database to store users sensitive information. In case of a any database failure or system outage this can result in issues with data accessibility and potential security breaches.


### Cloud Sync
In traditional 2FA apps, if users sync their cloud connection, there is a chance that providers may sell their user data.

### Device Limitations 
If a user loses their registered device, they can't receive any SMS, OTPs, or emails, which could lead to a loss of access to their account. But, with the help of Web3OTP users can access their accounts from any platform that supports wallet services
