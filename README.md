# Web3OTP 

Web3OTP is a wallet-based authentication system that stores 2FA secrets with public-key encryption in a decentralized storage system based on the Zk rollup protocol. Only the user can decrypt or view these secrets, and they can generate dynamic OTP tokens for web2 and web3-based applications, based on Internet Engineering Task Force standard RFC 6238. Access is possible on any device by connecting an EVM-based wallet.
